LING,LING 140a,Discourse and Pragmatics,Prerequisite: LING 100a or enrollment in the Master of Science in Computational Linguistics program.,"Assuming a theory of sentence-level linguistic competence, what phenomena are still to be accounted for in the explication of language knowledge? The class explores topics in language use in context, including anaphora, deixis, implicature, speech acts, information packaging, and pragmatics of dialogue. Usually offered every second year.",
LING,LING 150a,Historical Linguistics and Language Change,Prerequisite: LING 100a.,"Introduces the study of historical linguistics and language change, using data from ancient and modern languages in a variety of language families. Examines types and mechanisms of change, linguistic reconstruction, and current theories about how and why change occurs. Usually offered every second year.",
LING,LING 160b,Mathematical Methods for Computational Linguistics,,"An introduction to the key mathematical concepts which belong to the basic repertoire of computational linguistic methods. Topics covered include combinatorics, discrete probability, linear algebra, and basic differential calculus. Usually offered every year.",
LING,LING 173a,Psycholinguistics,,"An introduction to modern psycholinguistics, with an emphasis on sentence comprehension and production. Questions concerning species-specificity and the neurological organization of language are included for consideration. Usually offered every second year.",
LING,LING 190b,Topics in Linguistics,See the schedule of classes for topic and prerequisite(s). Maybe repeated for credit with permission of the instructor.,"Advanced topics in linguistics, varying by year. Usually offered every second year.",
LING,LING 195a,Introduction to Research in Linguistics or Computational Linguistics/Natural Language Processing,"Prerequisite: Junior standing or higher, and either (a) LING 120b plus one of LING 110a, 130a, or 140a, or (b) COSI 115b and concurrent enrollment in COSI 231a.","Introduction to researching a topic of interest from the primary literature and doing independent research in linguistics or computational linguistics/natural language processing. In short assignments, class presentations, and a final research paper, students gradually complete the initial stages of a research project. In the process, the course explores scholarly and scientific approaches to research in various areas of linguistics and computational linguistics/natural language processing, including the relevant terminology, concepts, and procedures associated with academic writing and research in these areas. Usually offered every year.",
LING,LING 197a,Language Acquisition and Development,Open to all students.,"The central problem of first language acquisition is to explain what makes this formidable task possible. Students will learn about the acquisition and development of phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics in child language. Additional topics to be covered include the brain and language development, experimental methods for evaluating the linguistic knowledge of children, second-language acquisition, bilingualism, and heritage language and heritage speakers.The overall goal is to arrive at a coherent picture of the language learning process. Usually offered every second year.",Keith Plaster
